# arrow-mino

Golang project using Arrow, Sqlite, Minio, NATS

URL: https://github.com/gedw99/arrow-mino

## Goal

A clean and simple solution for Data and Multimedia (images and video) to be indexed with SQLite enabling Arrow FlightSQL based data queries and updates.

More info here: https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/FlightSql.html

The example can all be installed easily with just a make file and be cross platform without any docker to make it very easy to run etc.

Itâ€™s also very small amount of code.

What follows is the proposed Architecture Stack...

## Development

All binaries and data is local to this repo and will not be put anywhere else on your system.

The 2 folders are:
.bin
.data

To install everything:

```sh
# All tools and servers are installed into the local .bin directory
make 0-dep

```

To run everything individually:

```sh
# all servers use the local .data directory

# boot minio
make 1-minio

# boot Arrow Sqlite for Flight SQL
make 2-sqlite

# boot caddy
make 10-caddy
```

To serve everything from a ProcFile:

```sh
make all-serve

```

To package for Desktop and Server deployment:

```sh
make all-package

```


## SQLite

We start from the SQLite example here: https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/main/go/arrow/flight/flightsql/example that we can built on top of.

## SQLite replication

We want:

- Multi master: Sqlite DB able to be scaled and redundant.
- Serverless: Marmot allows snap-shotting to and from Minio.

Use:

- https://github.com/maxpert/marmot
- Uses NATS Jetstream : https://github.com/nats-io/jetstream

## Minio cluster

We want:

- Multi master: Minio is highly redundant and scalable with very little admin required.
- CDC: When anything changes in Minio, we inform Sqlite, so that any other actors that change minio is informed to Sqlite.

Use:

- Admin: https://github.com/minio/madmin-go
- CDC base on : https://github.com/nats-io/demo-minio-nats


## Caddy Proxy

Wa want:

- To make it secure and easy to do so.

Use:

- with Authelia Auth.
- https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/forward_auth#authelia
- https://www.authelia.com/integration/proxies/caddy/


## Admin GUI

We want:

- Arrow Flight SQL GUI for Admin and Devs / Users

Use:

- Pure Go templates.
- HTMX based updates to Browser, so that any changes stream to all web tabs and to parts within a web page.
- https://github.com/acaloiaro/hugo-htmx-go-template
  - Hugo with Htmx, makes it very easy to build a Web Admin and Docs
  - Can also be run in User Mode, so that Users can add Markdown, and it creates the HTML on the fly.
- https://arrow.apache.org/docs/js/
  - Have not used this, but lets see what it can provide.
- https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/discussions/2898
  - Pocketbaes uses Sqlite and might be a good based

## Deplyoment

Fly.io can run a single docker that has the binaries injected and a ProcFile. This is a very simple way to run.

Replication and HA:

Fly.io also can scale up and down across regions, and Minio and NATS will keep all regions in sync.
